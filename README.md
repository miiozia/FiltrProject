The project presents the implementation of changing an image through a monochrome filter and negative. 
The program has been developed using ASM and C++ languages, utilizing a graphical user interface (GUI) written in C#. 
The application allows for active user interaction, where a user can upload an image into the program. 
Depending on their choice, the program will use one of two dynamic libraries written in C++ or MASM64 to apply the monochrome filter. 
The user has the option to specify the number of threads that will be used to execute the program. 
Additionally, the application displays information about the time that will be spent on performing specific operations using the chosen library.
